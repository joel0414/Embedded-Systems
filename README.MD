# Embedded Systems Project

## [Lab 1 LED Light Bar Simulation](Lab_1)
This lab uses the TM4C123G microcontroller to control two sets of 3 LEDs where one set emits red while one emits blue. Three patterns were developed so that the LEDs would turn on and off based on the pattern. A structure will be used to store the patterns and the possibility of editing them in the future. A switch is also used to switch between different patterns or when looking at the code looping through the structure array.

## [Lab 2 Home control System]
This lab aims to implement a typical home control system using the TM4C123G microcontroller. For example, a switch connected to a buzzer will ring if the switch is pressed. And where an LED is controlled by another switch with which, if the button is pressed, the light will turn on. In the final case, two switches are connected to a light, and either switch can turn the light on or off.
